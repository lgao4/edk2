# CI and PR Gates

## Background

Historically, while the TianoCore maintainers and stewards have done a fantastic job of keeping contribution policies consistent and contributions clean and well-documented, there have been few processes that ran to verify the sanity, cleanliness, and efficacy of the codebase, and even fewer that publicly published their results for the community at large. As such, the codebase is rife with cross-dependencies and modules that don't build on all supported toolchains, just to name a couple issues.

Adding continuous integration (and potentially PR gates) to the checkin process ensures that simple errors like these are caught and can be fixed on a regular basis.
